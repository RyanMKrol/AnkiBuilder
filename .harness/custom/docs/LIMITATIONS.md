# custom/docs/LIMITATIONS.md — this project's trade-offs & limitations log

Customization overlay for `.harness/docs/LIMITATIONS.md`. **This is where your project's own
limitation/trade-off rows go** (golden rule 5): when a change introduces a trade-off, bottleneck, or known
limitation, add a row **here** — not in the pristine `docs/LIMITATIONS.md`, which is plugin-owned and
refreshed on upgrade. Harness upgrades never touch this file. (See `.harness/custom/CLAUDE.md`.)

Each row: what it is, *why* it was chosen, its **impact**, and *when to revisit*.

## Translate batch parsing strips markdown fences, but a batch can still fail outright

- **What:** `translateCorpus` (`src/translate/index.js`) calls the pinned Haiku model via `claude -p`
  per batch of up to 10 items. The model is instructed to respond with raw JSON only, but sometimes
  wraps the array in a ` ```json ... ``` ` fence anyway; `parseBatch` now strips a single leading/trailing
  fence before parsing. If the response is malformed in some other way (truncated, extra prose,
  nested fences), the whole batch's items still fail together and must be retried by re-running
  `translate` after deleting `cards.json` (the CLI only regenerates when the file is absent — it
  does not resume just the failed ids).
- **Why:** batching keeps the cheap pinned model's context small per call; the fence-stripping fix
  only guards against the one failure mode actually observed (occasional markdown wrapping), not
  every possible malformed response.
- **Impact:** on a run with several batches, one bad batch means re-running translation for the
  *whole* corpus, re-spending API calls on batches that already succeeded.
- **When to revisit:** if malformed-batch failures keep recurring after this fix, add per-item retry
  (re-invoke `runClaude` for just the ids missing from a batch) instead of requiring a full corpus
  re-run.

## `assemble --epub` reads one chapter per command — no whole-book, one-shot loop yet

- **What:** `src/corpus/epubArchive.js` now reads a real `.epub` archive directly (a dependency-free
  zip reader, ported from the deleted mechanical extractor, plus new `META-INF/container.xml`/OPF
  spine parsing) — `assemble --epub <path> --chapter-number <N> --lang <language>` self-extracts
  chapter `N` in correct reading order, no manual pre-extraction step required. What's still
  missing: a single command that builds every chapter of a book in one shot. Today that's still one
  `assemble`/`review` cycle per chapter number, even though `listChapters(epubPath).chapters.length`
  already gives the loop bound needed to build that command.
- **Why:** the per-chapter primitive (real archive access, dedup, registry) was the harder, riskier
  part and needed validating first; a whole-book loop over an already-working per-chapter command is
  comparatively mechanical.
- **Impact:** building a deck from a real textbook still requires running `assemble`/`review` once
  per chapter by hand — there's no single-command "build my whole book" path yet.
- **When to revisit:** when that's actually annoying enough to be worth a `--epub <path> --all`
  (or similar) loop over `listChapters(...).chapters`.

## OPF/container.xml parsing is a hand-rolled scanner, not a real XML parser

- **What:** `src/corpus/epubArchive.js` isolates `<tag ...>` occurrences with a narrow per-tag-name
  regex, then extracts `attr="value"` pairs from within each isolated tag separately — deliberately
  order-independent (EPUB doesn't guarantee attribute order), but not a real XML parser. CDATA
  sections, XML comments containing tag-like text, or other unusual-but-legal XML wouldn't parse
  correctly.
- **Why:** every other EPUB-processing piece of this codebase already avoids an XML/HTML-parser
  dependency the same way (regex-based, targeted extraction) — this keeps the project genuinely
  dependency-free rather than making an exception for one module.
- **Impact:** low in practice — real-world EPUBs are near-universally produced by consistent tooling
  (Calibre, Sigil, publisher pipelines) that emits plain, well-formed `container.xml`/OPF documents —
  but a hand-authored or unusually-generated EPUB could misparse silently rather than erroring.
- **When to revisit:** if a real EPUB is found to misparse — add a targeted case to the scanner
  rather than reaching for a full parser unless several distinct cases pile up.

## Backward dedup only catches exact-string duplicates, not paraphrases

- **What:** `dedupBackward` (`src/corpus/epubDedup.js`) matches `english` case-insensitively and
  `target` exactly (both trimmed) against every earlier reviewed chapter of the same book. A
  differently-worded duplicate (e.g. "How much is this?" vs. "What does this cost?") is not caught
  by this pass — only the forward LLM pass has any chance of catching semantic overlap, and only
  for content it judges is *explicitly re-taught*, not merely similar.
- **Why:** exact-string matching is deterministic, free, and instant — the intentional trade-off
  for a "hard drop" pass that runs on every `assemble --epub` call with zero API cost.
- **Impact:** near-duplicate phrasing across chapters can still slip through and needs to be caught
  during `review` instead.
- **When to revisit:** if near-duplicate leakage across chapters proves common in practice — would
  need a semantic-similarity check (embeddings or an LLM call), a real cost/complexity step up from
  the current pure-function pass.

## Forward dedup re-reads every later chapter's content on every `assemble --epub` call

- **What:** `dedupForward` extracts (or reuses a cached extraction of) every chapter after the
  current one and asks the model to Read each of them fresh, every time `assemble --epub` runs for
  a book. The extracted *bytes* are cached (`epubs/<epubHash>/chapters/<N>.xhtml`), but the forward
  pass's *result* is not — there's no memoization of "I already checked chapter 3's items against
  chapters 4-10 and got this answer."
- **Why:** keeping the pass simple (re-derive the answer every call) was chosen over adding a
  result-cache invalidation story (what invalidates it — a later chapter's content changing? the
  candidate item list changing? both are plausible and neither was worth the complexity yet).
- **Impact:** real latency/cost that scales with how early you are in a long book — chapter 1 of a
  20-chapter book means the model reads chapters 2 through 20 on every `assemble` call for chapter 1.
- **When to revisit:** if this cost/latency becomes a real practical annoyance — cache the forward
  pass's `{kept, dropped}` result keyed by (epubHash, chapterNumber, a hash of the candidate item
  ids), invalidated whenever any later chapter's registry entry changes.

## The category enum is a first-cut list, not yet validated against real usage

- **What:** `src/model/categories.js`'s `CATEGORIES` list (25 entries) was drafted in one sitting
  to give every corpus item a shared, enum-constrained `category` — 8 entries match the
  travel-essentials template's existing categories, the rest are new and aim for general textbook
  coverage (family, work, school, nationalities, grammar/function words, etc.), plus an `"Other"`
  fallback.
- **Why:** some categorization is needed now (item 1–3 of this feature), but the "right" set of
  categories can really only be judged against real extracted corpora across multiple chapters/
  languages — that data doesn't exist yet.
- **Impact:** some items may end up in `"Other"` more than intended, or a category may prove too
  broad/narrow once used against real textbook content.
- **When to revisit:** after running the LLM extractor across several real chapters — check the
  `"Other"` rate and whether any category is doing too much or too little work, then adjust
  `CATEGORIES` (this is a single, centrally-imported list, so renaming/splitting an entry is a
  small change).

## `pronunciation` conflates a real romanization system with an ad hoc phonetic respelling

- **What:** both translate prompts (`buildFullTranslationPrompt` / `buildPronunciationOnlyPrompt`
  in `src/translate/index.js`) ask the model to prefer a target language's standard romanization
  or transliteration system when one exists (e.g. romaji for Japanese, pinyin for Mandarin
  Chinese), falling back to an invented English-spelling phonetic respelling otherwise. Both cases
  are written into the same `pronunciation` string field on the card — there's no way to tell,
  from the card alone, which kind of value it holds.
- **Why:** a single field was the smallest change that let the guidance be added without touching
  `CARDS_SCHEMA`; deciding whether the distinction actually needs its own schema field was
  deliberately left open rather than guessed at (see `docs/translate-prompts.md`'s "Open
  question").
- **Impact:** a deck built for a language with a real romanization system (Japanese, Mandarin,
  etc.) can't distinguish "this is the standard romanization, worth its own display treatment"
  from "this is just a rough phonetic hint" — both render identically in the Anki template.
- **When to revisit:** if a deck's presentation ever wants to treat the two differently (e.g. show
  romaji more prominently than an ad hoc respelling), split `pronunciation` into a
  `romanization`/`phonetic` pair on `CARDS_SCHEMA` and have the model report which kind it
  produced.
